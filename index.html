          <img src="images/Argentinosaurus.jpg"> <p>The Argentinosaurus is 
            my favorite dinosaur because it is one of the largest land animals of all
            time. It reached lengths of over 100 feet and weight estimates range from 
            50 to 100 tons. The large size of some dinasaurs has always been fascinating 
            for me, with memories of seeing dinasaur bones during school field trips to 
            the Field Museum in Chicago.
